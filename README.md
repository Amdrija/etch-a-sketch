# Etch-a-Sketch

## Introduction
This is a project from the Odin Project curriculum. It's essentially a grid which you can sketch on. 

## How it works
You have a squared grid whose cells get colored when you hover over them with your mouse. You have 3 modes:
- Black, which colors the grid cells black
- Rainbow, which colors the grid cells with a randomly chosen color
- Shades of Gray, which colors the grid cells by making them 10% darker every time you hover over them
  
You can also create grids of varying sizes, up to 200x200, by pressing the New Grid button.
